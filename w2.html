            <ul>
                <li>
                    What I learned:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>In this week, the most helpful thing I learned is expanding with flex grow. I think thats
                                very useful. Sizing with flex - basis also very good for styling. I also found sothing
                                is very interesting which is position text over picture. So I used it in my weekly blog.
                                I also find <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp">Hero
                                    Image</a> is cool. I'm thinking about to use this kind of stuff in my project.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Question I have:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The problem I have for this week which is I don't understand the code which in your
                                solution for lab6:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <pre>#right > img{}</pre> and also
                            <pre>#left > div:nth-child(3) {}</pre>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                why do you use ">" here?
