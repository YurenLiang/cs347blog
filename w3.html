        <h1>What I have learned:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For this week's lecture, I'm really interested in slideshow. In my opinion, I think it like a website
                form of power point. So I do my blog use the format of the lab, but without looking the solution. I also
                found this vedio list below is a very cool way to do slideshow. Maybe I will use this way in my project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Also Collapsible Boxes is cool, but I don't know where I can make it useful; Dropdown Menu is useful, I
                also plan use in my project.
            </li>
