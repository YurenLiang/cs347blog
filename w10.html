    <p>
        After the whole semester, I have some feeling about this course. I can't speak for everyone, but for me, I think
        I had a great learning experience. The lecture vedios were very helpful and I can always repeated watching them,
        there were good materials for learning. For every lab, I think they could also help me practice, but for most of
        them, we didn't get a solution, I think there will be great if after every lab, we can get the solution for
        them, and maybe spend some time to disscus them in class... Because I don't have many experience about web
        development, so I think that would be helpful. Overall, I think I have a lot of harvest, I'd like to say thank
        you so much Dr. Johnson! (Set your favorite color as the background color :) )
