    <h2 class="section">What I Have Learned</h2>
    <p>

        href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-redux-hooks-useselector-and-usedispatch-f7d8c7f75cdd">React-Redux Hooks: useSelector and useDispatch</a> page was very helpful for useSelector and useDispatch.    
    </p>

        I will keep studying the materials. It's really a challenge for me.
