        <h1>What I have learned:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When I was trying to searching for what is "router", I found this "A router allows your application to
                navigate between different components, changing the browser URL, modifying the browser history, and
                keeping the UI state in sync". I think it's really brifly and clear. and also this one "A tool that
                allows you to handle routes in a web app, using dynamic routing. Dynamic routing takes place as the app
                is rendering on your machine, unlike the old routing architecture where the routing is handled in a
                configuration outside of a running app."
            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>
                And I found this about ReactDOM was help me easy to understand "ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM
                specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing
                DOM elements of the web page. ReactDOM provides the developers with an API"
            </li>

                I also found this vedio was very helpful:

        <ul>
            <li>Besides the ability to set an "activeClassName" on NavLink, is there any reason to use NavLink over Link?</li>
