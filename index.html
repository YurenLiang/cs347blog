            What I learned:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In this week, the most important thing for me is learned how to styling code use CSS. For
                        example, change font, size, color and selectors. Also box Model give us more options to how to
                        set outer layers of margin, border, and padding. But for picture layout, I still not very good
                        at it, so I need more practice to get familiar. </p>

            Question I have:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>When I was doing this blog, I got a question which is how can we put different iteams(tags) into
                        one row. For example, if I want to put a marquee tag after a header, what should I do?</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
