        <h2>What I have learned:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In my understanding, JSX makes things easier to write React applications, but we can also write it
                without it.
            </li>
            <h3>JSX:</h3>

            <h3>Without JSX</h3>

            <li>
                Also I found this explanation is very succinct and clear about React components, "Components are
                independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in
                isolation and returns HTML via a render function. Components come in two types, Class components and
                Function components. Another way of handling component properties is by using props. Props are like
                function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes."
            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>
                I also found this vedio was helpful:
            </li>

                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>


        </ul>

        <h2>Question I have:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In an application. Does React stand for front end and express stand for back end? Is this right?</li>
        </ul>
