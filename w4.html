        <h1>Fourth Week's Review</h1>
        <h2>What I have learned:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In this week, I have decided the layout of my project, I want to do a slide down toggle in my project.
                So I found following vedio is very helpful
            </li>
                <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSr3SuDToSc" frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <li>
                Also I found something very interesting to me. In CSS @media rule there are some syntax and we can use
                some keyword define the code "not", "only", "and" etc.
            </li>
            <figure>
                <img src="w4.jpg">
                <figcaption>Example code</figcaption>
            </figure>

        </ul>

        <h2>Question I have:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For this week's material, I don't have specific question so far. Just keep working on the project.</li>
        </ul>
